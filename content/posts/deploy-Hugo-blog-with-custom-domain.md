# Introduction
A blog is an amazing way to build your personal brand by sharing the knowledge, that we accumulate ever yday. Simply put, a blog is an academic paper with a broader audience and allows more flexibility in tone, structure, and writing stylee. This article aims to guide readers to build a static site on their local machine, then upload it to Github to finally publish it on a custom domain.

# What is Hugo
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is one of the most popular open-source static site generator built with the Go programming language, known for its speed and flexibility. Other popular open-source static site generator alternatives include [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), which I will be covered in future tutorials.

# Why choose Hugo?
Not everyone is an HTMl programmer, and most people do not want to become one. It allows you to write content using the simple and intuitive [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax, while Hugo handles the conversion to HTML and publishing to your site. Hugo follows the Go languageâ€™s philosophy of simplicity, offering a gentle learning curve and comprehensive documentation. In this tutorial, I will explain why Hugo is a great choice for building a free blog.
